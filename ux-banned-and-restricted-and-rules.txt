Rules References
MAGIC: THE GATHERING® TOURNAMENT RULES, Effective May 18, 2020
2.1 Match Structure
A Magic match consists of a series of games that are played until one side has won a set number of games,
usually two.

Magic Comprehensive Rules, Effective April 17, 2020 
103.2, "After the decks have been shuffled, the players determine which one of them will choose who takes the first turn. In the first game of a match (including a single-game match), the players may use any mutually agreeable method (flipping a coin, rolling dice, etc.) to do so. In a match of several games, the loser of the previous game chooses who takes the first turn. If the previous game was a draw, the player who made the choice in that game makes the choice in this game."

Rules for UX Match Structure
UX will use a best of 5 game structure. Games 1/2 are played without sideboarding. Play order will be determined using Comp. Rule 103.2.
